abstract = {This paper explores the urban land-use determinants of the urban heat island (UHI) in Beijing’s Olympic Area, using different statistical models, land surface temperatures (LST) derived from Landsat 8 remote sensing, and land-use data derived from 1-m high-resolution imagery. Data are captured over grids of different sizes. Spatial regressions are necessary to capture neighboring effects, particularly when the grid unit is small. Grass, trees, water bodies, and shades have all significant and negative effects on LST, whereas buildings, roads and other impervious surfaces have all significant and positive effects. The results also point to significant nonlinear and interaction effects of grass, trees and water, particularly when the grid cell size is small (60 m-90 m). Trees are found to be the most important predictor of LST. When the grids are smaller than 180 m, the indirect impacts are larger than the direct ones, whereas, the opposite takes place for larger grids. Because of their strong performance (R2 ranging from 0.839 to 0.970), the models can be used for predicting the impacts of land-use changes on the UHI and as tools for urban planning. Finally, extensive uncertainty and sensitivity analyses show that the models are very reliable in terms of both input data accuracy and estimated coefficients precision.}

abstract = {The continued increase in average and extreme temperatures around the globe is expected to strike urban communities more harshly because of the urban heat island (UHI). Devising natural and design-based solutions to stem the rising heat has become an important urban planning issue. Recent studies have examined the impacts of 2D/3D urban land-use structures on land surface temperature (LST), but with little attention to the shades cast by 3D objects, such as buildings and trees. It is, however, known that shades are particularly relevant for controlling summertime temperatures. This study examines the role of urban shades created by trees and buildings, focusing on the effects of shade extent and location on LST mitigation. A realistic 3D digital representation of urban and suburban landscapes, combined with detailed 2D land cover information, is developed. Shadows projected on horizontal and vertical surfaces are obtained through GIS analysis, and then quantified as independent variables explaining LST variations over grids of varying sizes with spatial regression models. The estimation results show that the shades on different 3D surfaces, including building rooftops, sun-facing façades, not-sun-facing façades, and on 2D surfaces including roadways, other paved covers, and grass, have cooling effects of varying impact, showing that shades clearly modify the thermal effects of urban built-up surfaces. Tree canopy volume has distinct effects on LST via evapotranspiration. One of the estimated models is used, after validation, to simulate the LST impacts of neighborhood scenarios involving additional greening. The findings illustrate how urban planners can use the proposed methodology to design 3D land-use solutions for effective heat mitigation.}

abstract = {The semi-transparent photovoltaic glazing (STPVG) façade can introduce comfortable daylight into the indoor space and achieve energy efficiency, which is a promising PV glazing façade system. However, it is susceptible to building shadow, reducing power generation efficiency. This paper established a coupled optical-electrical-thermal model under dynamic changing building eave shadow of the STPVG façade and built a full-scale experiment platform to test and verify the coupled model. The model was then used to simulate and analyze the electrical performance and the temperature distribution of the STPVG under different eave shadow. The results show that the I/V curve appears multi-knee shape and the P/V curve appears multi-peak shape due to the different shadow coefficient in each PV string. Furthermore, the annual overall energy performance of STPVG in Changsha, China was compared with different eave width. The transmitted solar radiation, the energy generation and energy conversion efficiency, and the total heat gain decrease with the eave width increases in the months when the shadow appears. When the eave width is 0.29 m, the monthly largest transmission loss rate is in May at 3.86%; the largest energy generation loss rate is in April at 15.3%; and the largest indoor heat gain reduction rate is in August at 3.28%. This study can provide theoretical guidance for the system optimization and engineering application of the STPVG in building energy conservation.}

In this study, HDKR/S (Hay, Davies, Klucher, Reindl/shadow) model is developed which is a modified HDKR model where influence of shadow is incorporated in the mathematical model. Four discrete rectangular buildings situated in four directions (North, South, East and West) around a BIPV thermal system are considered for creating adverse effect of shadow. Variation of width (B), storey height (H) and horizontal distance (D) of these surrounded buildings are taken into account for evaluating optimum tilt angle, insolation and performance of BIPV thermal system by introducing corresponding shadow effects. The performance of the system is adversely affected because of the presence of surrounded building located at close proximity i.e., due to higher influence of shading and sky view blocking effects.}

ABSTRACT = {Although many efforts have been made on building shadow detection from aerial images, little research on simultaneous shadows detection on both building roofs and grounds has been presented. Hence, this paper proposes a new method for simultaneous shadow detection on ghost image. In the proposed method, a corner point on shadow boundary is selected and its 3D approximate coordinate is calculated through photogrammetric collinear equation on the basis of assumption of average elevation within the aerial image. The 3D coordinates of the shadow corner point on shadow boundary is used to calculate the solar zenith angle and the solar altitude angle. The shadow areas on the ground, at the moment of aerial photograph shooting are determined by the solar zenith angle and the solar altitude angle with the prior information of the digital building model (DBM). Using the relationship between the shadows of each building and the height difference of buildings, whether there exists a shadow on the building roof is determined, and the shadow area on the building roof on the ghost image is detected on the basis of the DBM. High-resolution aerial images located in the City of Denver, Colorado, USA are used to verify the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the shadows of the 120 buildings in the study area are completely detected, and the success rate is 15% higher than the traditional shadow detection method based on shadow features. Especially, when the shadows occur on the ground and on the buildings roofs, the successful rate of shadow detection can be improved by 9.42% and 33.33% respectively.},

abstract = {Data collection is moving towards more details and larger scales and efficient ways of interpreting the data and analysing it is of great importance. A Building Information Model (BIM) includes very detailed and accurate information of a construction. However, this information model is not necessarily geo located but uses a local coordinate system hampering environmental analysis. Transforming the BIM to its corresponding geo-located model helps answering many environmental questions efficiently. In this research, we have applied methods to automatically transform the geometric and semantic information of a BIM model to a geo-referenced model. Two analyses, namely view and shadow analysis, have been performed using the geometric and semantic information within the geo-referenced BIM model and other existing geospatial elements. These analyses demonstrate the value of integrating BIM and spatial data for e.g. spatial planning.}

ABSTRACT = {Multi-dimensional representation of urban settings has received a great deal of attention among urban planners, policy makers, and urban scholars. This is due to the fact that cities grow vertically and new urbanism strategies encourage higher density and compact city development. Advancements in computer technology and multi-dimensional geospatial data integration, analysis and visualisation play a pivotal role in supporting urban planning and design. However, due to the complexity of the models and technical requirements of the multi-dimensional city models, planners are yet to fully exploit such technologies in their activities. This paper proposes a workflow to support non-experts in using three-dimensional city modelling tools to carry out planning control amendments and assess their implications. The paper focuses on using a parametric three-dimensional (3D) city model to enable planners to measure the physical (e.g., building height, shadow, setback) and functional (e.g., mix of land uses) impacts of new planning controls. The workflow is then implemented in an inner suburb of Metropolitan Melbourne, where urban intensification strategies require the planners to carry out radical changes in regulations. This study demonstrates the power of the proposed 3D visualisation tool for urban planners at taking two-dimensional (2D) Geographic Information System (GIS) procedural modelling to construct a 3D model.},
